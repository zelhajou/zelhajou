👋 Hello, world! I'm Zakaria, a passionate Developer from Morocco.

💻 What drives me:
 - Crafting elegant solutions to complex problems
 - Continuous learning and staying ahead of tech trends
 - Collaborating on innovative projects

🌟 When I'm not diving into code, you'll find me:
 - Diving into water - swimming is my passion! 🏊
 - Capturing moments through my camera lens 📸
 - Seeking adventures in nature's playground 🏞️

💡 Fun fact: I once debugged code in my sleep. Proof that developers never truly log off!
